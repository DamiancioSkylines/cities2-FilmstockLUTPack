## Filmstock LUT Pack for Lumina

Elevate your visuals with this LUT pack, designed to bring a more cinematic and less digital aesthetic to your cityscapes. By emulating the characteristics of classic Kodak and Fujifilm film stocks, this pack delivers richer colors, enhanced contrast, and a noticeable reduction in the game's inherent yellow tint. Definitely different ascetic little retro, especially at close-ups.
# Brief Usage:
After downloading, LUTs should show up, but if not, you need to relaunch your game once or couple times, eventually, mod copies the LUT's and preset in Lumina folder.
1. Load your save game and open the Lumina menu and go to the first tab.
2. Import the Filmstock preset by typing "Filmstock"
3. Press "IMPORT PRESET"
4. Tick the "ENABLE LUMINA VOLUME" else nothing will apply eather preset or LUT's
5. Navigate to the "Tonemapping" tab (sun inside a square).
6. Set the "Tonemapping Mode" to "External"
7. Choose a "Tonemapping Texture" from the list (e.g. "Dam_Filmstock_FJ_D65")
8. Ensure LUT Contribution is set to 1; else you will have white and saturation clipping. Use adjustments in the last tab instead to fine-tune later.
9. Click "Load LUT"

# Know Issues:
- Some custom textures for the terrain are honestly designed overexposed maybe to look better for vanilla tonemapping, but they may be very bright with this LUT's
- Overall LUTs are created with way better technique then Candy Commercial I almost eliminated color banding, and middle grey value should be very close to the vanilla tonemapping but everything else above middle grey value has increased gain as I tried to tone down and roll off saturation in high end resulting in increase in gain. With next pack I may find better technique.

# Extra notes
- This LUT pack is designed to provide a good level of contrast right away. However, for some maps with significant fog or no global illumination, you may want to slightly lower shadows in Lumina or reduce Exposure. Alternatively, if you use the "PreservePhotoMode" mod, tinting the regular fog to a mid-greyish blue can alleviate the lack of contrast on foggy maps and in fact reduce sky cast on shady parts of mesh and metal materials like chrome on motorcycles for example for more realistic lighting.
- These LUTs are designed to work effectively in any season and at any time of day, especially when paired with maximum graphics settings and the loaded preset settings
- Adjusting behaves little differently from vanilla tonemapping, because of increased contrast and more gain in high-end, saturation custom hue shifts in blues, reds, greens, skintones, and film emulation so be gentle with it.

Anywho fine tune to your liking but beware of reducing LUT contribution unless you like nuclear colours and white clipping.

# LUT List:
— **Dam_Filmstock_FJ_D55** (Warmest)
- **Dam_Filmstock_FJ_D60** (Slightly warm)
- **Dam_Filmstock_FJ_D65** (Coolest)
- **Dam_Filmstock_KD_D55** (Warmest)
- **Dam_Filmstock_KD_D60** (Slightly warm)
- **Dam_Filmstock_KD_D65** (Coolest)

My favourite are D60 versions and probably will be easiest to alter to your liking, especially when you want to tune the temp and tint for perfect white balance as probably you prefer neutral white balance for YouTube or social media in general.
